## Overview

This site provides users a one-click interface for deploying and managing their very own node for the [RaiBlocks](https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks) cryptocurrency. The site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static site generator, and theme provided by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo). The underlying technology is [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) which deploys virtual servers (EC2 instances) to the AWS public cloud infrastructure and configures them as RaiBlocks nodes to contribute to the network. All of the code is freely available to use on [Github](https://github.com/lalanza808/raiblocks-node-deploy).

This site is free to use and browse, but **running servers on AWS will cost you money**. The author of the site is in no way responsible or liable for any costs incurred from the usage of this site. Management and security of the AWS account is the responsibility of the account owner (you).

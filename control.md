In order to launch a node on AWS cloud, you must be signed into your account. If you need an account, you can sign up for free, <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/free/' target='_blank'>here</a>.

If you've created a new account, the best practice to follow is to harden security of the root account and to generate an IAM user for management usage. Read more about that [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html).

Before you launch anything, please be sure to <a href="/about/">read the disclaimer</a> and remember that provisioning servers will cost you money.<br /><br />
